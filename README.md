# NVMDoom: Legal Version

This is a version of [the NVMDoom mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/national-videogame-museum) that I am calling a "legal version" due to me deleting all of the potentially copyright-infringing (I'm not a lawyer) unmodified id Software Doom textures that were included in the original download, but apart from that, everything is all the same.

Feel free to upload this to the [/idgames archive](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Idgames_archive).

Below is a copy of the README file that was attached to the ModDB download for this PK3 as well as, what I can assure you, is quite a cool disclaimer.

                          only to find that it has been completely overrun by

Following this, just because I have mirrored a project, this also does not mean that the author endorses me or my work.

If you are reading this and are wondering why exactly [that this disclaimer](https://github.com/DynTylluan/disclaimer) is inside of this project, it is simply here as a blanket way for getting out of trouble if myself or the project owner gets into hot water in some way, just in case. This is a standard text that is in all of [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan) mirrors and _does not automatically_ mean that the project owner is a bad person or is untrustworthy.
