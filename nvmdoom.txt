Description             : "After years of planning, you finally make the trip
                          to Texas to visit the National Videogame Museum,
                          only to find that it has been completely overrun by
                          demons! With your trusty Super Shotgun in hand, rip
                          and tear your way through the hordes of hellspawn
                          to clear out the annals of video game history!"
