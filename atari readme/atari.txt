LEVEL 1
Start: On balcony, outside main conference room.

What the hell happened?  You only called 1-800-GO-ATARI to order the latest Jaguar game and suddenly, ZAPPP!  You find yourself in Sunnyvale California, at Atari's Corporate headquarters.  But wait, is this Atari-- or is this Hell?  No, it's-- A T A R I   H E L L   ! ! !

You're going to have to dive into the wild world of the Atari game testers and artists before you even have a chance at getting off the second floor.  The blue key is somewhere back in their area.  
 
After securing the blue key you can tackle the programming and engineering sections.  Be sure to visit Leonard(2) and give your regards.  I hear they're working on designing a new rocket launcher in the lab.

When you have the yellow key you can take on the Executives.  You'll find the CFO, the CEO, and God knows what.  Don't forget to stop by the legal department(4).  You know what to do to lawyers.  Then stop by and say hi to Sam(6) and Jack(7).  Laury(8) wouldn't want to be left out.  

Tired of wrestling with those staircases?  After you grab the red key, if you have any breath left in your body, you can crawl to the elevator and take it down to the lower level.

LEVEL 2
Start: Inside elevator on lower level

Be careful when you get off the elevator.  You face one of your biggest challenges and they seem to made out of old Atari 2600 and 7800 parts.  If you can stay alive you'll need to start hunting for the blue key.

What's the matter?  Can't find the yellow key in the dark?  Help's available if you can find it.

Now if you can just get a hold of that red key, you'd be able to leave the building.  Watch out for impromptu press conferences.

Whew! You're outside.  You probably noticed through the windows in back that the exit is in the back of the building.  Hey, who put those walls there?  "Master, there's three nasty looking switches over there!".
